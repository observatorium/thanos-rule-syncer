# NOTE(efried): Since we reference images by digest, rebuilding an image
# with the same tag can be Bad. This is because the digest calculation
# includes metadata such as date stamp, meaning that even though the
# contents may be identical, the digest may change. In this situation,
# the original digest URI no longer has any tags referring to it, so the
# repository deletes it. This can break existing deployments referring
# to the old digest. We could have solved this issue by generating a
# permanent tag tied to each digest. We decided to do it this way
# instead.
# For testing purposes, if you need to force the build/push to rerun,
# delete the image at $IMAGE_URI.
